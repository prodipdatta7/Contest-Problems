The first line of the input contains a positive integers **N**, denotes the number of cities in the kingdom. <br>
The next **N - 1** lines contains the description of the roads .<br>
Each road is described by three positive integers **u, v, k**, where **u** and **v**  denotes two cities which is connected by this road and **k** denotes the availability of the road (**0** or **1**). <br>
The next line contains a positive integer **Q**, denotes the number of query.<br>
Each of the next **Q**  lines will describe a group of people, which is a query to be answered .<br>
Each line  will begin with a positive integer **g**<sub>i</sub>, which denotes the number of people in the <strong>i</strong><sup>th</sup> group. Then in the same line **g**<sub>i</sub> space separated numbers will be given which denotes the cities where the people of this group reside.<br>
**Note, that there can be more than one people in each city.**<br><br>
**1 ≤ N, Q, u, v ≤ 2 × 10<sup>5</sup>**. <br>
**u != v**. <br>
**1 ≤ u, v ≤ N** <br>
**0 ≤ k ≤ 1.** <br>
**1 ≤ g**<sub>i</sub> **≤ 2 × 10<sup>5</sup>** <br>
**Sum of all**  **g**<sub>i</sub> **≤ 2 × 10<sup>5</sup>.** <br>
