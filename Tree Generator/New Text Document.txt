You are given the int N, the int[]s edge and int[]s val, and the ints D, seed. Use the pseudocode below to generate the edges of the tree and the values of all its nodes.

A[0] = seed
for i = 1 to 2*N-1:
    A[i] = (A[i-1] * 1103515245 + 12345) modulo 2147483648

V = val
for i = size(val) to N-1:
    V[i] = A[i]

E = edge
for i = size(edge) to N-1:
    E[i] = A[N+i] modulo min(i,D)

for i = 1 to N-1:
    the tree contains an edge between i and E[i]
